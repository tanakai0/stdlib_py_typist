# stdlib_py_typist
Typing Game Built with Python Standard Library.


## üéµ Sound Configuration

- **Windows OS Enhanced**: While the program is designed to run silently by default, Windows users can take full advantage of the winsound library for a more personalized auditory experience!

- **How to Configure**: Place your own .wav sound files in the assets/sound directory. Once you've added your sound files, you can set loop soundtracks for different screens as well as configure sounds for correct and incorrect answers via the settings menu, accessible from the title screen. This feature is particularly optimized for Windows operating systems.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

### Sound Support

1. **Windows OS Only**: This program utilizes the `winsound` library for sound effects. Therefore, sound may not work on operating systems other than Windows.

### Database Security

2. **SQL Injection**: This program uses SQL databases. Be cautious of SQL injection vulnerabilities when making changes to the database code.
